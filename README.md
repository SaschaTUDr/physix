# Physics: Year 10

This textbook loosely follows the course in Physics taught at Riga State Gymnasium No 1. The main focus is on mechanics with the following topics discussed in detail:

- Kinematics of translational motion (uniform motion, uniformly accelerated motion, motion in uniform gravitational field);
- Kinematics of rotational motion (uniform rotation, uniformly accelerated rotation);
- Forces (addition and resolution, Newton’s laws of motion);
- Friction and drag (Coulomb–Amonton‘s law, static and dynamic friction, dependence of drag on velocity, terminal velocity);
- Elasticity (Hooke’s law, stress, strain, elastic modulus, ultimate stress);
- Conservation laws (energy, momentum, collisions);
- Equilibrium (moment of force, translational and rotational equilibrium);
- Dynamics of rotational motion (moment of inertia, angular momentum);
- Gravitation (Newton’s law of universal gravitation, gravitational field, Kepler’s laws, orbital and escape velocities);
- Hydrodynamics (Pascal’s principle, hidrostatic pressure, buoyancy, continuity and Bernoulli equations);
- Oscillations (stability of the equilibrium, equation of SHM, its solution, energy transfer in SHM).

The secondary focus is on the experimental skills including:

- designing the experiment (variables, setup);
- performing measurements with simple instruments (ruler, vernier caliper, scales, measuring cylinder, dynamometer);
- estimating uncertainty of a single measurement;
- estimating uncertainty of a series of measurements;
- estimating the propagation of uncertainties;
- plotting graphs;
- linearising data;
- using linear regression to estimate parameters of the system and uncertainties thereof;
- evaluating signifcance of different factors on the quality of results.
