# PhysiX

This textbook follows the course in Physics taught at Riga State Gymnasium No 1 in Year 10 covering fundamentals of classical mechanics and aiming to develop problem solving, experimental and critical thinking skills.

Some accordingly marked sections of the book contain advanced level material and are primarily aimed at the students who are willing to participate in Physics Olympiads.

The course also aims to develop the following experimental skills:

- designing the experiment:
  - choosing independent, dependent and controlled variables;
  - designing the experimental setup;
- performing measurements with simple instruments (ruler, vernier caliper, scales, measuring cylinder, dynamometer);
- estimating uncertainties:
  - instrumental uncertainty of a single measurement;
  - random uncertainty of a series of measurements;
  - propagation of uncertainties in calculations;
- working with graphs:
  - choosing suitable scales and plotting a graph;
  - linearising data;
  - using linear regression to estimate parameters of the system and uncertainties thereof;
- evaluating signifcance of different factors on the quality of results.
