## Scientific endeavour

Once upon a time…

The main goal of physics, as well as other natural sciences such as chemistry and biology, is to understand and describe how nature works.
A more structured description can be found in @IBPhysicsGuide.


## Quantities, units, numbers

- Vectors ($\vec{F}$ or $\bm{v}$), scalars ($m$, $t$, $V$), tensors.
- SI
- Base units ($\mathrm{m}$, $\mathrm{kg}$, $\mathrm{s}$, $\mathrm{A}$, $\mathrm{K}$, $\mathrm{mol}$)
- Derived units ($\mathrm{N}$, $\mathrm{W}$, $\mathrm{rad}$, $\mathrm{sr}$…)
- Prefixes (k, M, G, T, m, µ, n, p, …)
- Related non-SI units ($\mathrm{min}$, $\mathrm{h}$, $^\circ$, $\mathrm{eV}$, $\mathrm{au}$,…)
- Universal constants ($c$, $h$, $k_\mathrm{B}$, $N_\mathrm{A}$,…)
- Significant figures
